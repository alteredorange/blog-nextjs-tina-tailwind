# Does a Math Degree Help in Software Engineering

I am currently in my fourth year of completing a double major in math and computer science at the University of Prince Edward Island. As such I am in a unique position to comment on my thoughts on whether or not a math degree will help one in software engineering. I have also been working in software development positions both part-time and full time for about two years. 

## What a math degree offers

## Will you use what you have learned

## Does it help you work as a software engineer?
