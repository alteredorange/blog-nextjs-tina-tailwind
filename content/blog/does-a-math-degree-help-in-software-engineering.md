# Does a Math Degree Help in Software Engineering

I am currently in my fourth year of completing a double major in math and computer science at the University of Prince Edward Island. As such I am in a unique position to comment on my thoughts on whether or not a math degree will help one in software engineering. I have also been working in software development positions both part-time and full time for about two years.

## What a math degree offers

In a math degree, you will start off by learning calculus, linear algebra, and other algorithmic-based learning. As you progress most of the math becomes [proof-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof). Generally, you are given a set of axioms (true statements) and using those you have to make some proof some proposition to be true. This forces you to think outside the box as no to problems are you can't just apply an algorithm to solve your problem. Some of these courses are [real analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis), [group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory) and [measure theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)).

## Will you use what you have learned

If you are going into university and wondering if a maths degree will be useful for a future in software engineering, the answer is practical, probably not. If your goal is to be a general software engineer and write code for web dev or a similar field that you most likely will not learn any of the facts or knowledge that a maths degree offers. There are some exceptions. If you think you might want a future in machine learning, cryptography, research, programming software bundlers, and the list goes on and on. These are some of the many fields where you will use the knowledge and skills of a math degree in practice. If you are thinking of going into one of these fields a math degree or possibly a minor will help you out tremendously.      

## Does it help you work as a software engineer?

Math courses challenge one in a way that traditional computer science courses do not. In math courses, specifically upper-year proof-based courses (which almost all of the higher-level math courses), really challenges one problem-solving skill in a way that you don't see in typically computer science courses.
